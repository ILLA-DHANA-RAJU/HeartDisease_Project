🫀 Heart Disease Analysis Using Python 💙
Hey there, darlings! This project is all about analyzing heart disease trends using Python, exploring how age and gender impact heart health. With data visualization and insights, we uncover hidden patterns to help understand heart disease risks better.

💡 Project Overview
This project focuses on:
✔️ Filtering & analyzing heart disease cases by age & gender
✔️ Visualizing trends to detect risk patterns
✔️ Gaining insights into heart disease prevalence
✔️ Laying the foundation for predictive health analytics
